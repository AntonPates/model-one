## Stock market prediction research

This project explores the effectiveness of machine learning models for stock price prediction by combining technical indicators and news sentiment analysis.

### Key Takeaways:  
- Incorporating news sentiment into forecasting models might improve the accuracy of forecast.  
- Hyperparameter tuning play a crucial role in enhancing model precision.  
- Despite the strong predictive accuracy, consistently outperforming the S&P 500â€™s Buy-and-Hold strategy remained a challenge emphasizing the importance of continuous model adaptation in real-world environments.


### Overview

- Trained 242 928 models for 482 S&P 500 companies
- Used LSTM neural networks with various configurations
- Incorporated technical indicators and news sentiment data
- Simulated trading strategies from Nov/2023 to Nov/2024
